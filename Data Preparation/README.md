# Data Preparation
### Code Implementation Steps:

1. **Data Preparation**  
   1.1 Data Resampling  
   1.2 Labeling  
   1.3 Data Integration  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   2.1 Rectifying Features   
   2.2 Handling Noisy Data  

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   3.1 Standardizing Units  
   3.2 Deriving New Features  

4. **Output Data Files**  
   4.1 "df_faults_woF.xlsx": Original Feature Dataset (data cleaned but no new features added)  
   4.2 "df_faults_even.xlsx": Engineered Feature Set (with derived features) for **Main Project** use
